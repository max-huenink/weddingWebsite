        The day started with breakfast in bed. Then we went to Creative Adventure Lab in Dubuque, IA to paint some pottery. We each painted a
        dinosaur and a mushroom. Next, we had lunch at Chipotle and headed to Galena, IL. In Galena we went to Scent Workshop and mixed some scents
        to create our own scented candles, and Alicia made a perfume! This did not take as long as expected, so we walked around doing some shopping.

        Finally, we headed back to Platteville, WI to go hike to the top of the M and get our photos taken. The plan was to see the sunset from the
        top of the M, but that didn't work out. It was really cloudy and we didn't get to see the sunset. But its the thought that counts! I proposed
        while our photos were being taken, she said yes! Then we headed back to Dubuque for sushi at Ichiban. Calling parents and grandparents on the
        way to tell them about the good news.
